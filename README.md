Fun little website I made for my mom. She's a german translator, and mainly translates official documents, so the site might be
a bit too flashy for her, but that was my whole point. Usually websites for people who wor for the government etc. are very serious and
boring - I tried to change that. My idea was to make a small, pleasant to look at website, that's also informative and useful.
I still have some work to do, mainly I have to make it responsive. I didn't use any official names of agencies, no real contact info, 
and the text is just lorem ipsum.
